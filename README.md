[GrainSizeTools](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00863) is a free, open-source, cross-platform script written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) that provides tools for (1) describing and visualizing grain size populations, (2) estimating differential stress for different mineral phases using paleopizometers and (3) applying stereological methods to approximate the true grain size distribution from 2D sections. The script **does not require any previous experience with the Python programming language** (see the documentation below and [FAQ](https://github.com/marcoalopez/GrainSizeTools/blob/master/DOCS/FAQ.md)). For users with programming skills, the script is organized in a modular (functional) way to facilitate reuse and code extension.

**Latest release: v3.0.2**  
**Date: 2020/12/31**  
See notes at https://github.com/marcoalopez/GrainSizeTools/releases/tag/v3.0.2


## Features at a glance

- Import and manipulate tabular data sets including text, CSV, or Excel formats.

- Fully automated descriptive statistics of grain size populations including:

  - Multiple averages (arithmetic and geometric means, median, and frequency peak ("mode") via Gaussian Kernel Density Estimator)
  - Estimation of robust confidence intervals (including some specific methods for lognormal populations such as the modified Cox or the GCI method)
  - Measures of dispersion and population shape
  - Normality and lognormality tests

- Estimation of differential stress using palaeopiezometers. Includes several piezometric relations for quartz, olivine, calcite and feldspar (more to come!)

- Ready-to-publish plots in bitmap or vector format (see screenshots below), including:

  - Histograms and kernel density estimates
  - Area or volume-weighted plots
  - Normalized plots
  - Quantile-quantile plots, and more

- Stereology methods (approximating the true 3D grain size distribution from data collected in flat sections):

  - Saltykov method
  - Two-step method (log-normal fitting, shape characterization)
