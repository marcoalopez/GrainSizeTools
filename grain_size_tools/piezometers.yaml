  - piezometer: Stipp_Tullis
    year: 2003
    reference: https://doi.org/10.1029/2003GL018444
    B: 669.0
    m: 0.79
    warn: Ensure that you entered the apparent grain size as the root mean square (RMS)
    linear_intercepts: false
    correction_factor: false
    notes: Only applies to recrystallization regimes 2 and 3 (SGR, GBM)

  - piezometer: VanderWal_wet
    year: 1993
    reference: https://doi.org/10.1029/93GL01382
    B: 1355.4
    m: 0.75
    warn: Ensure that you entered the apparent grain size as the root mean square (RMS)
    linear_intercepts: true
    correction_factor: 1.5
    notes: The Van de Wal (1993) piezometer was calibrated using the linear intercept (LI) grain size multiplied by 1.5 (correction factor). ECDs without stereological correction are converted to LIs using the empirical equation of De Hoff and Rhines (1968) LI = (1.5 / sqrt(4/pi)) * ECD

  - piezometer: Jung_Karato
    year: 2001
    reference: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0191-8141(01)00005-0
    B: 5461.03
    m: 0.85
    warn: Ensure that you entered the apparent grain size as the root mean square (RMS)
    linear_intercepts: true
    correction_factor: 1.5 
    notes: The Jung & Karato (2001) piezometer was calibrated using the linear intercept (LI) grain size multiplied by 1.5 (correction factor). If equivalent circular diameters (ECD) without stereological correction are used, they must be converted to LIs using the empirical equation of De Hoff and Rhines (1968) as follows LI = (1.5 / sqrt(4/pi)) * ECD
