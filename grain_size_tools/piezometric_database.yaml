      Shimizu:

        warn: Ensure that you entered the apparent grain size as the median in log (base e) scale
        linear_intercepts: false
        correction_factor: false
        notes: |
          The Shimizu (2008) piezometer requires entering the grain size as the
          logarithm of the median apparent grain size calculated using equivalent
          circular diameters with no stereological correction. It uses a different
          piezometer model to the Twiss model in which the stress estimation is
          temperature-dependent.

        B: 550.0
        m: 0.68
        warn: Ensure that you entered the apparent grain size as the arithmetic mean grain size
        linear_intercepts: false
        correction_factor: 1.5
        notes: |
          Twiss (1977) piezometer was calibrated using the linear intercepts (LI) multiplied
          by 1.5 (correction factor). Equivalent circular diameters (ECD) without stereological
          correction must be converted to LIs using the empirical equation of De Hoff and
          Rhines (1968) as follows LI = (1.5 / sqrt(4/pi)) * ECD
