    Shimizu:
      year: 2008
      reference: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsg.2008.03.004
      B: 352.0
      m: 0.8
      warn: Please ensure that you have entered the apparent grain size as the median in log (base e) scale.
      linear_intercepts: false
      correction_factor: false
      notes: |
        The Shimizu (2008) piezometer requires entering the grain size as the
        logarithm of the median apparent grain size calculated using equivalent
        circular diameters with no stereological correction. It uses a different
        piezometer model to the Twiss model in which the stress estimation is
        temperature-dependent.
  
    Twiss:
      year: 1977
      reference: https://www.doi.org/10.1007/BF01637105
      B: 550.0
      m: 0.68
      warn: Please ensure that you have entered the apparent grain size as the arithmetic mean grain size.
      linear_intercepts: false
      correction_factor: 1.5
      notes: |
        Twiss (1977) piezometer was calibrated using the linear intercepts (LI) multiplied
        by 1.5 (correction factor). Equivalent circular diameters (ECD) without stereological
        correction must be converted to LIs using the empirical equation of De Hoff and
        Rhines (1968) as follows LI = (1.5 / sqrt(4/pi)) * ECD

        multiplied by 1.5 (correction factor). ECDs without stereological correction will be converted
        to LIs using the empirical equation of De Hoff and Rhines (1968) LI = (1.5 / sqrt(4/pi)) * ECD

      notes: Only applies to subgrain rotation recrystallization

      B: 538.40
      m: 0.82
      warn: Please ensure that you have entered the apparent grain size as the root mean square (RMS) in linear scale.
      linear_intercepts: false
      correction_factor: false
      notes: |
        Contrary to other calcite piezometers, this one was calibrated using the RMS mean
        instead of the arithmetic mean.
  
    Valcke:
      year: 2015
      reference: https://doi.org/10.1144/SP409.4

        equivalent circular diameters (ECD) grain size with no stereological correction.
