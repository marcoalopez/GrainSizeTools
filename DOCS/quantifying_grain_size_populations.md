> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You should be probably using the median or the geometric mean, not the arithmetic mean**. In summarizing skewed distributions, the median and the interquartile range are usually more meaningful than the arithmetic mean and standard deviation...TODO



## 3. Representation of grain size populations

> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.



### 3.x Testing lognormality or normality

### 3.x The area-weighted distribution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> _**When to use and not to use the area-weighted approach?**_
> You **should not use** the area-weighted mean for the calibration of paleopiezometers or for the comparison of grain size populations, as this is a poorly optimised central tendency measure ([Lopez-Sanchez, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsg.2020.104042)). On the other hand, the area-weighted distribution is useful to visualize the coarser size range, since in number-weighted distributions these sizes are diluted but can represent a significant area or volume.
