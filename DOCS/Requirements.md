Requirements

-------------



The scripts requires [Python][1] 2.7.x or 3.4.x and the scientific libraries [*Numpy*][2], [*Scipy*][3], [*Pandas*][9] and [*Matplotlib*][4] installed in the system. We recommend installing the [Continuum Anaconda][5] or the [Enthought Canopy][6] (maybe more easy-friendly for newbies) distributions, since they are free (at least the basic versions) and provide the most popular Python scientific packages including those named above. Both packages also provide academic free licenses for more advanced versions. In case you have space problems, there is a distribution named [miniconda][7] that only installs the just the packages you actually need.



The approach of the script is based on the estimation of the areas of the grain profiles obtained from thin sections. It is, therefore, necessary to measure them in advance and store the results in a text/csv file in order to use the script and derive the actual grain size population. To measure the grain sectional areas, we highly encourage you to use the [*ImageJ*][8] program, or one of their different flavours (see [here](http://fiji.sc/ImageJ)), since it is a public-domain image processing program widely used for scientific research that runs on Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms. The main aim of this documentation is not to describe how to measure the areas of the grain profiles with the *ImageJ* application but how to treat the data obtained from this or similar applications. If you are not familiarized with the *ImageJ* application don't worry, there are many tutorials on the web. Just search the terms *'ImageJ'* and *'areas'* in your favorite search engine and you will find your answers. Furthermore, you have a quick step-by-step tutorial [here](https://github.com/marcoalopez/GrainSizeTools/blob/master/DOCS/imageJ_tutorial.md)
