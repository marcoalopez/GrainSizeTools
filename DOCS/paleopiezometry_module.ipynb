    "## Estimate the stress using the average grain size\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "The paleopiezometry module includes a function named ``calc_diffstress()`` for estimating differential stress based on \"average\" recrystallized grain sizes. The function requires careful consideration of the following factors for correct differential stress estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. definition of the mineral phase and the piezometer relationship to be used\n",
    "2. enter the (apparent) grain size as **equivalent circular diameters** in microns\n",
    "3. enter a specific average (arithmetic mean, median, etc.) with **no stereological correction**,\n",
    "4. set the stress framework, either uniaxial compression/extension or plane stress, for proper stress correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the first factor, GrainSizeTools includes a database of paleopiezometric relations, including the most common mineral phases quartz, calcite, olivine and albite feldspar. In addition, the script facilitates the writing of ad hoc piezometric relations. As we will see later, it is also very easy to add new piezometric relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second factor, the function assumes by default that the average grain size you specify has been estimated using equivalent circular diameters (ECDs). As some piezometric relationships, especially those established longer ago, were established using linear intercepts (LI) rather than ECDs, the function will automatically convert ECDs to linear intercepts if necessary using the Hoff and Rhines (1968) correction. This means that **you do not need to worry about whether the piezometer was originally calibrated using linear intercepts**, always use averages based on equivalent circular diameters in microns. The function will explicitly warn you when using this ECD ti LI of conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third factor is key for the correct estimation of differential stress, as each paleopiezometry relationship has been calibrated to a specific average grain size (e.g. the arithmetic mean, median or RMS mean) and thus **only gives valid results if the same type of average is used**. In addition, **you must not apply any type of stereological correction to the calculated grain average**, if the author(s) of the piezometer used any type of stereological correction during calibration, your input will be automatically corrected by the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth factor means that the user must decide whether or not to correct the differential stress estimate for plane strain using the correction factor suggested by Paterson and Olgaard (2000). The reason for this is that piezometer calibration experiments are mainly performed in uniaxial compression, whereas natural shear zones behave approximately like plane-strain volumes.\n",

However, the stress estimates are already an average and calculating a mean of the averages is mathematically incorrect. Similarly, to look at the raw grain size data from all the grain maps and make the estimate from there is also mathematically incorrect. The first approach ignores the uncertainty in any estimate of the average and the second ignores the uncertainty within and between experimental conditions (or measured areas). The correct procedure is to take the weighted mean of the averages, where each mean is weighted by its variance."
