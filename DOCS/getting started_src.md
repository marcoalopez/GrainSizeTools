# Getting started

The aims of this section are

- How to install Python using the Anaconda or Miniconda distributions.
- How to install GrainSizeTools.
- How to use Python with tools like Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- How to interact with the script and import data.

## Installing Python for data science

TODO

## Downloading the GrainSizeTools script and script organization

Once Python is installed, the next step is to download GrainSizeTools. Click on the download link below (there is also a direct link on the website).
